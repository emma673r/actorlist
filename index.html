    <!--****** Extras *******

    You are not required to add anything else, but if you have the time, and need inspiration, think of some of these features:

    Make the list filter the actors into different movies
    Make the list sort the actors by first or last name
    Make the list color the actors differently, depending on which movie they are in
    Add animations to open and close "details" or "movies" when selecting different actors or movies -->

    <h1>Actor List</h1>
    <h2>Here is an actor list, click on one to see wich movie they were in</h2>
    <div class="list-result">
      <div id="actor">
        <!-- <btn class = "actor"></div> -->
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="actor-details">
      <!-- actor content -->
      <div class="actor-details-content">
        <!-- <h2 class = "actor-fullname">Actor Name Here</h2>
          <p class = "actor-movie">Movie Name</p>
 -->
      </div>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
